# Credit Card Fraud Detection

This repository contains code and resources for a credit card fraud detection project, focusing on highly imbalanced datasets. The goal of this project is to develop machine learning models that can accurately detect fraudulent credit card transactions.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is highly imbalanced, where fraudulent transactions represent a small fraction of the overall data. The dataset consists of various features related to credit card transactions, including transaction amount, time, and anonymized variables. Due to privacy concerns, the original dataset has been anonymized and preprocessed.

## Algorithms and Techniques

In this project, we explore multiple classification algorithms to tackle the challenge of imbalanced data. The following algorithms were implemented and evaluated:

1. Logistic Regression
2. Support Vector Machines (SVM)
3. Decision Trees
4. Random Forest Classifier
5. KNN Classifier
6. Naive Bayes Classifier

We applied appropriate preprocessing techniques, such as feature scaling and handling missing values, before training and evaluating the models. Additionally, we employed sampling techniques like oversampling (SMOTE) and undersampling (RandomUnderSampler) to address the class imbalance problem.

## Evaluation Metrics

To assess the performance of the models, we considered various evaluation metrics suitable for imbalanced datasets, including accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC-ROC). These metrics provide a comprehensive understanding of the models' abilities to correctly identify both fraudulent and legitimate transactions.

## Results

After thorough experimentation and evaluation, we achieved the highest accuracy of 92.38% using the Random Forest Classifier. This model demonstrated superior performance in accurately identifying fraudulent credit card transactions, showcasing its effectiveness in handling highly imbalanced datasets.
